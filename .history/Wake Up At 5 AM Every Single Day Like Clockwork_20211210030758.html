      Waking up early is equal to <strong>reduced stress levels</strong> and <strong>peace</strong> is its effect. When you rise early, it removes the need to rush in the morning. It is then that your day starts on an optimistic note, and this positivity stays with you throughout the day.

    <h2 class="blog-h2">The Secret of Success of World Class Performers</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      What do you, Narendra Modi, Bill Gates, Mukesh Ambani, and all the successful people do have one thing in common?.
     <br> They all have <strong>24 Hours in a day.</strong><br>
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>Successful people WAKE UP EARLY!</li>
        <li>Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, wakes up at 4! a.m.</li>
        <li> <strong>Apple CEO,</strong> Tim Cook wakes up at <strong>3:45am</strong> every morning. </li>
         <li>Actors Dwyane Johnson (The Rock), Mark Wahlberg, Akshay Kumar, all wake up between 4 to 5 am every day.</li>
         <li>Virat Kohli wakes up at 5am. World Class athletes from Olympic Gold winners, to Chess Grandmasters to Race Car drivers all wake up early.</li>
         <li>Narendra Modi wakes up at 5am. YOU get the idea!</li>
      </ul>
      <br> </p>

      <h2 class="blog-h2">Three reasons why you should wake up at 5am?</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        <h3>REASON 1: More productive time! </h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2">
          <li>Successful people create more "productive time" for themselves.</li>
          <li>Nobody is doing anything productive after 10pm.</li>
          <li>Compared to a typical "Early Riser" waking up at 7am, who works form 8am, successful people wake up at 5am and start working by 6am. So you get <strong>2 hours extra</strong> till 8am. </li>
           <li>Which is equal to 52-60 hours extra work/productive hours every month.</li>
           <li>Considering 8-hour workdays for an average individual. You get <strong> 7 working days more</strong> per month!</li>
           <li>12 weeks or nearly 3 extra months every year! </li>
           <li>This is just compared to an "early riser waking up at 7 am!" For people waking up at 9 or later, the difference is 6-12 months a year!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

      <strong>Instant gratification</strong> is a strong urge to fulfill a desire instantaneously.. In short the tasks which we do now and get the pleasure now. <br><br>

      <ul style="line-height: 2">

        <li>Eating tasty but unhealthy snacks.</li>
        <li>Turning off or pressing snooze button of the alarm to sleep more.</li>
      </ul>
