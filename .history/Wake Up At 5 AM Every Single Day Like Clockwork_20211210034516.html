      Waking up early is equal to <strong>reduced stress levels</strong> and <strong>peace</strong> is its effect. When you rise early, it removes the need to rush in the morning. It is then that your day starts on an optimistic note, and this positivity stays with you throughout the day.

    <h2 class="blog-h2">The Secret of Success of World Class Performers</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      What do you, Narendra Modi, Bill Gates, Mukesh Ambani, and all the successful people do have one thing in common?.
     <br> They all have <strong>24 Hours in a day.</strong><br>
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>Successful people WAKE UP EARLY!</li>
        <li>Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, wakes up at 4! a.m.</li>
        <li> <strong>Apple CEO,</strong> Tim Cook wakes up at <strong>3:45am</strong> every morning. </li>
         <li>Actors Dwyane Johnson (The Rock), Mark Wahlberg, Akshay Kumar, all wake up between 4 to 5 am every day.</li>
         <li>Virat Kohli wakes up at 5am. World Class athletes from Olympic Gold winners, to Chess Grandmasters to Race Car drivers all wake up early.</li>
         <li>Narendra Modi wakes up at 5am. YOU get the idea!</li>
      </ul>
      <br> </p>

      <h2 class="blog-h2">Three reasons why you should wake up at 5am?</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        <h3>REASON 1: More productive time! </h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2">
          <li>Successful people create more "productive time" for themselves.</li>
          <li>Nobody is doing anything productive after 10pm.</li>
          <li>Compared to a typical "Early Riser" waking up at 7am, who works form 8am, successful people wake up at 5am and start working by 6am. So you get <strong>2 hours extra</strong> till 8am. </li>
           <li>Which is equal to 52-60 hours extra work/productive hours every month.</li>
           <li>Considering 8-hour workdays for an average individual. You get <strong> 7 working days more</strong> per month!</li>
           <li>12 weeks or nearly <strong> 3 extra months every year!</strong> </li>
           <li>This is just compared to an "early riser waking up at 7 am!" For people waking up at 9 or later, the difference is 6-12 months a year!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>REASON 2: It transforms Your Belief System! </h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2">
          <li>You go from feeling "behind" others to feeling <strong>"ahead of"</strong> others.</li>
          <li>You go from believing you can do it to actually <strong>DOING IT!</strong></li>
          <li>You go from feeling sorry for yourself to <strong>respecting yourself</strong> and even boasting about waking up early to others!</li>
           <li>You go from getting that 'late' feeling every day to the being 'early' feeling every single day.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>REASON 3:  It transforms your image to the outside world! </h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2">
          <li>Your family starts respecting you more.</li>
          <li>Your friends start admiring you </li>
          <li>Your boss/colleagues/business partners would admire your performance as you get more done!</li>
           <li>All these people's admirations boost your self-esteem and confidence! </li>
           <li>All these people's beliefs about you reinforce your own belief system and further strengths you and the cycle goes on.</li>
           <li>You will start loving this life and NEVER want to go back to waking up late again!</li>  
        </ul>
      </p>

        <h3>THE BIGGEST MINDSET CHANGE NEEDED:</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2">
          <li>Waking Up at 5am starts at night, not in the morning! </li>
          <li>Know WHY you need to wake up early.</li>
          <li>Know EXACTLY what you are going to do, the moment you wake up, thus compliting task without doubting on what to do.</li>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">

          <li>STEP 8: Wake Up at 5am. Drink the water. If you wake up before 5am, Do not go back to bed.</li>
